\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project: Grain boundary (GB) detection in noise optical microscopy image using weighted support vector machine\
\
Author: Guoqiang Xu\
\
This project is aimed to incorporate information from multiple images to make accurate detection of GB position using weighted support vector machine.\
\
Instructions: \
\
1. In the main.m, set the prefix variable to the path where the microscopy images are. In this implementation, it is assumed the images are named by 1.tif, 2.tif, \'85 \
\
2. Select a region with interest to do the analysis by setting variables xlow, xhigh, ylow and thigh. Notice that the algorithm uses kernelized svm and therefore if the region selected is too large, you may run out of memory.\
\
3. Run main.m\
\
4. Some implementation is still under the way, not completed.}
